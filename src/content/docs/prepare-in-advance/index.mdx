You should start preparing for job hunting as soon as you can. Start when you're in
- Middle School 
- High School 
- College
- Trade School

Anytime you do anything that you're proud of (or your family is proud of) should be documented and saved for potential use in getting a job. 

- Did you achieve a high rank in scouting?
- Did you win or even participate in prestigious competitions?
- Did you manage the Ski Team in High school? It could show responsibility and leadership if so. 
- Were you on the Constitutional Law debate team? Public speaking and thinking on your feet.- Were you on the Formula Racing Team and manufacture carbon fiber parts? Tenacity, iteration and engineering design
- Were you a Martial Arts instructor with black belt? Tenacity and leadership
- Playing in the school band or any sports teams means you have teamwork skills and maybe even leadership
- Babysitting shows the ability to be responsible for other human beings and we know how hard it can be to convince children to behave.

Whether any of these skills are relevant to your job really depends on what job you want to apply to.
