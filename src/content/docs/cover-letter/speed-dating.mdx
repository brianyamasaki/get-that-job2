A cover letter is a little bit like speed dating. We are trying to impress someone so that they trust us,  will spend time with us, and eventually be attached to us.

> Let's pretend the person you are trying to court is named Casey.
> - Casey wants to know how well you match with his/her needs
> - Casey wants to know how much you appreciate being with him/her
> - Casey wants to know that you will be faithful to him/her for an extended time. 
> - Casey wants to see the authentic you, not some clever lines you heard before

Sounds similar to to a company hiring somebody to work for them, doesn't it. 

In a paragraph describing yourself, tell how much you enjoyed a project, what you learned (about yourself or your team), how deeply you are connected to your team, how impressed you were by the success of your team, how something changed you. 
Be honest and authentic.

My examples sound silly, but can’t you think about something during schooling or projects that stirred your emotions and imagination? **THAT’s** what you talk about.
