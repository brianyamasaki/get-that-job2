You will get overly broad, general questions of which there are no simple answers. **If given an overly broad question, you get to choose how you want to answer these questions**. Your answers should be short yet descriptive and lead in the direction you want them to ask about. In short, answer with an [Elevator Pitch](/common-ideas/elevator-pitches).

## Q: Tell me about yourself
You should have two to three sentences that end with how excited you are / interested to learn / enjoyed projects about whatever topic your job is about. This is your first Elevator Pitch – 15 to 30 seconds to interest the listener.

A half sentence aside at the beginning is OK, but don’t give a complete life history. 

-  I just graduated from ____________ with my degree in ___________ and I’m most interested in &lt;job title / description of type of job&gt; because of my last project. I got really excited / fascinated / intrigued by &lt;some aspect of the project&gt;, &lt;another aspect of the project&gt; and I really enjoyed discovering &lt;yet another aspect of the project&gt;. I’m focusing my career toward &lt;job title / type of job&gt; because &lt;come up with a reason&gt;.
- Ever since I was a child, I loved to build things using Legos, I really like designing and building things with my hands. I got my &lt;random degree&gt; from &lt;Random University&gt; because of this interest and my classes and projects have deepened my interest in &lt;random topic&gt;. I find that I enjoy doing &lt;random topic&gt; for people – I love to serve my clients and change their life for the better.

Fifteen to thirty seconds to engage the interviewer and lead them to ask further questions about your interests. When possible lead them to answer questions that you already have prepared another elevator pitch.

## Q: Why are you applying for this job?

Pretty much the same as above.

## Other common questions

There are a plethora of websites that list out common HR questions. It’s your job to come up with Elevator pitches for as many as you can. 

Be prepared by having answers to silly questions like:
- What are three of your weaknesses?
- Where do you see yourself in five years?

## Practice, Practice, Practice

Create an elevator pitch for every common interview question you can think of and practice answering them. Practice on your family and friends when delivering your pitch and ask them if you seem "natural."

It's going to feel very unnatural to be practicing these pitches over and over. If you want to succeed in life, you're going to have to get [comfortable with being uncomfortable](/common-ideas/being-uncomfortable)
