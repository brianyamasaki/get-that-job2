We are taught from a young age to be modest, to not brag and to always tell the truth in an accurate, complete story. If that’s what you are taught, it feels wrong to emphasize the positive features and hide the negative features. You are going to have to work hard at changing how you “sell yourself” in an interview compared to your normal personality. 

It is hard work to change how we speak but learning how to sell yourself can be learned with practice – a lot of practice. 

## Write Your Pitches Down on Paper

Come up with your ideas and write them down. Emphasize the big ideas, the big emotions, the attention getting phrases. Then how did you help this happen? What was your part in this transformation or effort? 
If it seems too boastful, imagine somebody else saying these things – a salesman you can imagine. It’s not a good idea to downright lie, but it’s OK to trumpet your successes while minimizing your failures.

## Practice Your Pitch

You must practice. Say this pitch out loud and record yourself. 
- Try the pitch without looking at your notes. It’s likely that when you reword your pitch, it can get shorter and even better. Keep playing with the words or ideas.
- Ask friends and family to ask you the question and use your answer
- Record a video of yourself answering the question with your pitch. Do you sound rushed? Do your eyes glance around the room? Do you nod or shake your head while you recite your pitch?

The listener is watching your body language, trying to figure out whether you believe your words.
