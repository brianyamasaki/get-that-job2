At any job you're applying for, it helps to show how well you can do the job. It's easy to start a project, but showing off an actual working project is different and more relevant to your employer. 
- If you're a graphic designer, show photos of some of your projects
- If you're a music producer, have snippets of songs you've created
- If you're a programmer, have examples of websites or projects you've worked on
- If you're a photographer, bring examples of photos that you've taken

As an example, I've created a portfolio website of my past jobs and projects that I wanted to put online. I've included past projects that I worked on, with a screen shot gallery as well as short descriptions of what the project did and what I worked on within the project

## Uses for your Portfolio

How important is having a portfolio? You can use the portfolio to show off your work in multiple ways.
 - **Include the portfolio when you apply for a job** Some jobs will require showing some of the stuff that you can do, from construction and home renovation to creative designers and engineers.
 - **Show people in your network** Sometimes they will suddenly realize they know somebody who needs somebody with your skills and might refer you to a job opening.
 - **Bring the portfolio to the interview** If you bring a portfolio of projects that you've completed, the interviewer is likely to ask you questions about how you created the project and details about how well the project went. These are questions that you know how to answer - much easier than aswering a random question about some contrived problem the interviewer has created to test your cleverness.
