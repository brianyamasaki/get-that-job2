Selling yourself is uncomfortable. Being turned down for a job is uncomfortable. Being asked hard questions is uncomfortable. Failure is uncomfortable. 

A reasonable person avoids discomfort as part of a happy life.

On the road to success, you’re going to be uncomfortable an awful lot of times. Start getting comfortable with the feeling of being uncomfortable.

<Quote author="S. Christian Wheeler" title="Professor of Management and Professor of Marketing at Stanford Graduate School Business">
“When we’re confronted with personal failure, it feels bad to us. And we work hard to try to avoid that failure, and that can often be counterproductive,” Wheeler says. “But failing is something that’s on the pathway to success.”
