Always remember that the recruiter’s job is to hire qualified workers who contributes to the company, stay for an “appropriately long time,” and fits in with the team, division and company’s ethics and culture. Isn’t this basically “speed dating?” When choosing somebody to date, you want somebody qualified (whatever that means to you), contributes to your couple hood (no freeloaders), sticks with you for as long as you want (hopefully you have matching time frames) and fits into your idea of a mate, maybe gets along with your friends and family? Of course, you’d want their dating ethics to match yours.

How would you expect to ask and answer questions on a Speed Date (30 minute job interview instead of 5 minutes for speed dating)? If somebody was boring you with facts you didn’t care about (or already knew from their resume), you’d probably choose somebody else to date. 

## Make every sentence of your answer count
Start with an interesting sentence that leads to details that you can fill in later. 

> **“Where did you go on vacation?”** should be answered with **“We went to Yellowstone, Zion and Yosemite National Parks where we saw geysers, hiked trails and white water rafted”** instead of **“Karl, Cindy, Teos and I met some old friends from high school.”** The first example immediately makes the listener want to ask questions about the parks and activities while the second sentence means nothing unless you happen to know Karl, Cindy and Teos. 

As they say, “Don’t bury the lead. Lead with the lead.”

> We went to Yellowstone, Zion and Yosemite National Parks where we saw geysers, hiked trails and white water rafted. The weather was amazing and we ran into bears a couple times while on the trail. I felt so refreshed from being in the beauty of nature, so I’m ready to start working on my next project. I went on this trip with some friends from high school….
