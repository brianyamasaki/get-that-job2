We're here to train job hunters better ways to apply for jobs. And maybe other things about job hunting like what to expect on your first day of work.

## Who We Are

This is a project started by Brian Yamasaki describing the techniques taught by the career counselors at the California State University at Long Beach. Neither the university nor any of the counselors are directly involved in this website, though the content of the website is based entirely on the descriptions of the job hunting techniques used by those counselors.

## Help the team
