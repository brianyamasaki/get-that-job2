## Two Pages!

Occasionally it might make sense to have a two page resume if your career is incredibly successful with dozens of achievements and multiple patents or scientific papers to your name and maybe a Nobel Prize. 
But to make a resume with multiple pages when it barely seem to fit in one page is simply going to [drive recruiters crazy and some might just throw out the resume simply on principle (don't waste my time)](/en/common-ideas/recruiters-are-busy).

## Personal Photograph

Unless you are applying for a job in as an actor, model or media personality, skip the photo, regardless of how handsome and beautiful you may be. If you are an actor or model, wouldn't a full page headshot be even better than a small thumbnail portrait?

The Profile section is a nice touch, but should probably be a bullet list or full paragraph of personal highlights including the Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) certification. The "Seeking Opportunities" doesn't really belong in the profile section, but probably [does belong on this resume as a goal statement](/en/resume/tips/goal-is-optional), which makes sense on this resume.
