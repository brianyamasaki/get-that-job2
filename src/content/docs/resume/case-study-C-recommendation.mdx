<ResumeC />

* Notice how the project titles emphasize "Machine Learning" and "Program." We want the recruiter to see immediately that these projects are all about programming.
* We keep the two column approach along with the color scheme. We adjust the widths of the columns until both columns have approximately the same length.
* We have shortened many items considerably, losing smaller details. Think of the resume as a "teaser" trailer - we can omit some details for the interviewer to ask about.
