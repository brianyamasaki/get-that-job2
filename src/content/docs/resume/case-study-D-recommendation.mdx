## Army Life is Leadership and Management

Our bullet points talk about leadership, training, tactics and strategy as well as the daily reports that are part of life as a leader in the US Army. All these skills are also utilized in firefighting, so we'll be sure to talk about them.
While other firemen may have been in military service, there's no guarantee that whomever reviews the resumes will know about all these aspects of being a Sergeant in the US Army.
