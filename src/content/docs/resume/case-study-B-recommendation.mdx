<Recommendation />

Again, this resume is filled with technical and engineering experiences that are impressive, but aren't 
necessarily the goal of the job description.
We are trying to show leadership and communication skills as often as possible since the project 
manager role is all about leadership, communication and negotiation (it's a job often compared to herding cats).
Many technical details were omitted to fit everything onto a single page of paper, but all details will be available 
on the applicant's LinkedIn homepage (listed in the contact information).
