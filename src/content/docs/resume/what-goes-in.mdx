## Make Your Resume Fit into a Single Page

As we've stated before, make your resume fit into a single page because recruiters do not want to waste all day reading a 3 page resume. [They might only skim the first page and reject your resume because they are busy](/common-ideas/recruiters-are-busy/). Leave out non-essential details, especially if these details aren't mentioned in the job description you are applying to.
