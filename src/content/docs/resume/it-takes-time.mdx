Plan on searching for a job for at least a couple months and applying to at least half a dozen jobs. That means writing a whole bunch of resumes and cover letters and remembering when you're supposed to get contacted and by whom. 

It gets even more complicated when you apply at large companies with tens of thousands of employees, dozens of office locations and hundreds of program groups. A response from Google could mean any number of locations around the world and hundreds of product groups or thousands of recruiters.

## Get Organized

* Keep track of all your resumes, cover letters and letters of recommendation
* Keep track of every job you apply to

> [Getting organized](/common-ideas/get-organized) can make your life much easier. Each job you apply to does not mean you should write a complete resume from scratch. There is a lot of Copy and Paste in applying to jobs. Organization makes it easier to find what you need to apply for any job.
