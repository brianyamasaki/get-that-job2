## Just Two Sections

This resume is slimmed down to ensure that we put in everything this job posting is looking for with as much detail as we have room to include. You don't have to include things that don't apply to the job posting, though adding memorable details would be fun. Being memorable can be nice, but it's not necessary.

We could put in specific objectives, but it's not necessary because we explicitly mention biochemistry experience. 

> If you have a specific specialty within biochemistry that you insist on working within, please **do** create an Objective or Goal section. 

## A Benefit of Removing Your Address

In this case, Kylee (a fictitious name, but an actual person) applied for a position and omitted her address as recommended. The company was located near Prestigous University and called her back and expected her to still be living near Prestigious University. 
If she had given her parents' address (a 6 hour drive away), she might not have been called back because candidates with equivalent resumes but closer addresses *may* have been called first.
Kylee drove 6 hours for an on-site interview and was offered the job!
