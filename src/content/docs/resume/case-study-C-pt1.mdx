## Things to Love

* This template is minimal in its use of colors and typefaces and every aspect helps a recruiter immediately find whatever they are looking for in the resume. 
* The use of a two column layout is optimal because there is no wasted space for items that are very short (Education and Relevant Courses don't require long sentences). 
* The sections are ordered properly, with the sections that show the applicant in the best light near the top and other section below them.

How can we improve on this?

* The [addition of a LinkedIn account](/en/resume/tips/use-linkedin) would be one of the very few additions to improve this section. 
* Consider changing the vertical bar that separates the phone number and email with a filled circle, just so the [vertical bar couldn't be confused with the number 1](/en/resume/tips/keep-it-readable) .
* The fact that the phone number and email has no label *might* be a problem if a [PDF scanning program](/en/resume/tips/no-icons-or-graphics) was looking for the phone number and email. On the other hand, the formatting of those letters and numbers are pretty unique and easy to figure out.
