### How To Adapt The Resume

The requirements above seem to want to know the following, so here are some actions that we will do

* **They want to see a commitment to education and learning**, so we will move the Education section to the top section and emphasize the learning and innovation in our project experience.
* **They want to see communication and collaboration skills** (i.e. teamwork and leadership), so every job description and activity will describe the teamwork and leadership learned and used.
* **They want to see organizational skills**, so we will be descriptive about whatever planning and record keeping is required in our jobs and activities.
