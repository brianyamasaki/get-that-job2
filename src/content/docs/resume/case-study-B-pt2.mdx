## Reviewing the Experience Section

![Experience in Engineering](/assets/resumes/eng1/eng-experience.jpg)

Here is where we see how the current resume makes the applicant looks like a hardware engineer, not a project management candidate. 
* The yellow highlighted area is actually experience doing the type of job the applicant wants.
* The green area is doing a personal software project. Very impressive stuff, but still not what the applied job would do.
* The blue highlighted area is using materials science and other engineering skills to make a physical item. Very impressive stuff indeed.

This is very impressive experience, but not exactly primed to get the job in project management. We'll need to expand the software portions to show off the skills the recruiter will be looking for. Of course, we will keep the hardware and other engineering experience, but we'll condense and simplify it. 

All the [details will be retained and saved in LinkedIn](/en/resume/tips/use-linkedin) for anybody interested in looking at everything the applicant has done.

### Keep Everything Understandable

Remember that the first person to read the resume is not necessarily technical, so buzzwords and acroynyms may be confusing. If the first 5 words of the sentence don't make sense, the reader may skip the entire sentence. Ask friends to read your resume and tell you when they don't understand anything.
