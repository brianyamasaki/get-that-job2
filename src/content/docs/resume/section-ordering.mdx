description: Prioritize your resume order to show them what they want to see

Make your resume show the most relevant parts of your training and experience first. Don't blindly follow advice that says you should show employment first on your resume. 

> Each employer is looking for their specific set of skills, experience and tenacity. Your job is to figure out what skills they value. Then make a resume that shows that you have those skills. If you are new to the job market and have very few relevant job experiences, then put in your education and project experiences first. 

- If you've been in the relevant job market for a while, put your employment history first
- If you're fresh out of college or technical training relevant to the job, put your education first. If you're still in school, be sure to show expected graduation dates. You may also want to list classes relevant to the job.
- If you've done projects or volunteer work that's relevant to the job, put this section first.
