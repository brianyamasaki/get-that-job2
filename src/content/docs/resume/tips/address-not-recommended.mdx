In the past, it was recommended to use addresses in the title line or footer. Now that email, blogs and resume sites like LinkedIn are commonplace, there is no advantage to using an address. 

In fact, it can be a **disadvantage** to include an address since some companies will prefer local candidates over those that must be moved from far away. 

[One job seeker](/resume/case-study-E-recommendation) who did not include her address surprised the recruiter who assumed she lived near the University she had recently graduated from. It's quite possible she wouldn't have been contacted if she had included her address as a 6 hour drive from the job location.

The only time you want to mention your locality is when you can easily commute to the job site you are applying to. You can mention things like “Local to Seattle Metropolitan area” or “In the South Bay Area.” You can skip it all if you’d like.
