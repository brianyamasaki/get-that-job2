## Be Reader Friendly

Reading resumes must be easy, or the recruiter may just throw it out without reading it.

- Use readable, high contrast and medium and larger fonts (no smaller than 10 point). While digital PDFs can be zoomed into, resumes are often printed out and handed around, reducing the ability to zoom.
- Never use hard to read fonts, like script or handwriting fonts, even if it looks interesting or fun.
- Do not use a background watermark image if it sacrifices readability of the text, especially when printed or photocopied.

## Make Your Resume Print Friendly

Printing out resumes are actually a good thing for you. You want people to look at your resume before you arrive and scribble notes on what they can ask you about during the interview (when you get the interview).

Be sure it prints out well in Black and White.
