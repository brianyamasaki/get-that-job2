## Put Your Complete Resume Online

Making a resume that fits on a single page of paper is actually pretty hard once you get some life and job experience under your belt. And even specific achievements in one job may not fit on a specific resume, but may be relevant to a recruiter in a way you can't predict. 

So create a free account on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com) and put up all your job and academic experiences up there. Take time to put everything up there and make it as accurate and spell checked as your own resume.

## Recruiters Search LinkedIn For Prospects

Headhunters and start up companies scour LinkedIn for prospective employees. If you're in a coveted profession, recruiters will be sending you emails every week to get you to join their company. Having many companies recruit you is great in many ways.

* It's a great ego boost to know you're wanted.
* You can find out how much they are offering in compensation and use that figure to get your current job to increase your salary. If your job can't match the salary and perks, then consider moving to the new company.
* Recruiters can tell you of interesting companies that may have more interesting projects that you are passionate about. Getting paid more for something you are more interested in is good, right?

## Creatives Should Create Online Portfolios

If you're an artist, photographer or designer, it's important to have something that will show off your most creative works. You can create your own portfolio website or you can use any service that will show off your works as a group. 
Be sure to put this in your contact information as a substitute for LinkedIn.
