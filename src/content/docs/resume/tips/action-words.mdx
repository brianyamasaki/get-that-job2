> Whenever possible use words that convey action, emotion and/or meaning

Instead of saying "I did this" or "I was that", use more descriptive words, i.e. "I created/designed/maintained this" or "Team Lead for Cloud Research."

| Instead of these | Try these |
|--------------|--------------|
| Did, Used, Worked | Created, Designed, Maintained, Updated |
| Accepted | Awarded |
| Worked as an instructor | Taught, Educated, Counseled, Managed |
