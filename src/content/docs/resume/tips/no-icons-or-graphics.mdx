Companies use AI Bots to scan text and PDFs to see if resumes meet their minimum requirements. You must make it easy for bots to scan and read.

Don’t use icons or graphics to replace words. And only use characters available on your keyboard

Bots can’t identify graphics or icons with ease, so don’t use them. As cute as a telephone handset would be to label your phone number, resist the urge and simply use letters - and only letters available on the keyboard.
