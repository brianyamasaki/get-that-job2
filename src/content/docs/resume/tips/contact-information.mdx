import BackButton from '@components/BackButton/BackButton'

If you want to hear back from your potential employer, you'd better make it easy to get back to you. Employers who hire using online job services expect that you are comfortable using the internet. 

1. Email Address - ensure that your email address isn't objectionable or in poor taste. Be sure to regularly check this email account regularly.
2. Phone Number 
3. LinkedIn URL - if you have a LinkedIn account (the account is free) is a fantastic way to convey a lot of details that won't fit on a single page resume.  
4. Portfolio URLs - if you have creative works that you want your employer to see, creating a portfolio of work online is a great idea

## Things to avoid

Avoid including your address unless you live within commuting distance to the job location. See [this page to learn why addresses can be a disadvantage](/resume/tips/address-not-recommended)

* Your birthdate or age
* Your photograph (unless the job requirement requires it)
* Any social media accounts (unless the job requirement requries it)
* Your marital status
* Any mention of your children
