> The summary at the top of the resume was suggested in the last century, but we don't recommend Goals, Objectives or Summary statements. 

Goal sections arenâ€™t required unless your experience listed in the resume seems out of line with the actual job you are applying for. 
In that case, your summary should clearly state what position or type of job that you are applying for. 

If your resume is properly targeted toward the job and showcasing the skills the employer is hiring for, then the summary is not necessary and usually a waste of space.
