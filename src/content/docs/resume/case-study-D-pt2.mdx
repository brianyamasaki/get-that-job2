## Being a Firefighter isn't Easy

Few people will qualify to be a Firefighter. There are academic requirements, psychological requirements, physical fitness requirements and organization / collaboration requirements that must be met. 

Here is an example set of requirements.

The Education, Experience License Requirements are extensive, but we won't review them here since the applicant's resume merely has to mention that they are achieved. Basically they are a check mark feature - you either have them or you don't and you can't make yourself look better at them than the next applicant.

## Expect Physical Exertion 

The Physical demands and ability is up to the applicant to meet and demonstrate and is beyond the scope of the this case study. We'd recommend that nobody applies to be a firefighter who doesn't expect to be in shape and stay in shape.
