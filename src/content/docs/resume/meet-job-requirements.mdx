If you want to get past the Artificial Intelligence and Human Resources gatekeepers, you must address the requirements listed in the job listing. 

In the project management job described in [this example mentioned previously](/resume/job-requirements.html#an-example-job-ad), every sentence and phrase of your resume must be focused on showing the recruiter your ability to:
- communicate
- manage schedules
- create documents and visual materials
- understand complex ideas and topics
- show leadership, negotiation, teamwork
- be credible and respected by your peers

Not only should you showcase those talents listed above, you should use the exact phrases mentioned in the job ad when possible. 

Project Manager can also be called Program Manager and Project Lead, but the AI looking into your document may only be looking for Project Manager. Use their words when you can (but donâ€™t copy and paste entire sentences).
